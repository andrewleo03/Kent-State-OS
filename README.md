Operating Systems Project #1 <br>
This product solves the consumer - producer problem in Linux. <br>
The shm.h is used to get a shared memory block between the two processes. <br>
The semaphore.h is used to ensure that the mutual exclusion is maintained <br>
Makefile is used to build and run the code <br>
The code runs 10 times and each time the producer will put something into the share <br>
buffer and then the consumer will take it out. The output is also output to the terminal.
